2.  **Copy the prompt:** Copy the entire content of the chosen markdown file.
3.  **Use with AI tool:** Paste the copied content as a prompt into your preferred AI-powered code generation tool (e.g., a large language model with coding capabilities).
4.  **Generate the code:** The AI tool will generate the Svelte components and pages based on the prompt.
5.  **Integrate and customize:** Integrate the generated code into your SvelteKit project and customize it as needed.
